## About Me

Hello! I'm DavidInfosec, a passionate sound engineer and front-end developer, soon to pursue a career in network engineering and security.


## My Technical Blog @ DavidInfosec.com

This is one the projects I have, where I outline plenty of all my experiments and things that I'm doing. My goal with DavidInfosec.com is to cultivate an environment for others to learn about technical in a fun and engaging way, while also helping to provide critical insight on processes where documentation is scarce.

## My Organized Approach to Reporting Cybercrime @ ReportName.com

This is a platform that provides an organized approach to reporting cybercrime, birthed out of my own frustrations with managing multiple tabs when I was taking action against threat actors through security vendor platforms. I wanted an answer to my own issue where I could visually keep track of each resource I would utilize, and soon it became a tool that would provide value to others. It is supported and well-respected by industry professionals, and that has encouraged me to pursue it as more than just a project.
