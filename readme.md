## My Favorite Projects

#### Contribute to a safe internet @ [ReportName.com](https://www.ReportName.com)

Discover an organized approach to cybercrime reporting. Born out of my frustrations with tab chaos, this platform allows visual tracking of resources. Respected by industry professionals, it's more than a projectâ€”it's a commitment to a safer internet.

#### My Technical Blog @ [DavidInfosec.com](https://www.DavidInfosec.com)

The goal with the DavidInfosec.com blog is to cultivate an environment for others to learn about my technical findings in a fun and engaging way, while also helping to provide critical insight on processes where documentation is scarce.

#### A Python Script @ [WHOIS-Domain-Info](https://github.com/davidinfosec/whois-domain-info) 

I created this one morning because I wanted to organized a large list of domain names that I manage. It speeds up a process that would have taken nearly double or triple the time and effort. Members in the domain name industry have found value with this tool as well.

#### A Python Script @ [Spotify to YouTube Link Converter](https://github.com/davidinfosec/sp.py)

I created this script because I wanted to send my friends music from YouTube, but I wanted an excuse to be lazy so I could put my time toward other projects.

#### A Python Script @ [Ely.gg CLI Lookup-Tool](https://github.com/davidinfosec/Ely.gg-CLI-Lookup-Tool)

I created this script because I wanted to save on time and computer resources when looking up community-submitted prices for items in a popular video game.

#### A Python Script @ [Audio-Stream Detection (VBAN Protocol)](https://github.com/davidinfosec/VBAN-Stream-Detect)

I created this in conjunction with a project for my church where I wanted audio streaming over the network to be detected automatically from receiving devices.
