## My Most Recent Project:

#### Blog post @ [How I've been refining my homelab](https://davidinfosec.com/2024/01/how-ive-been-refining-my-homelab/)

I recently upgraded from my traditional method of using PfSense’s built in DNS Resolver to translate to my local domain names, and I pointed the DNS in the resolver to a container running Nginx Proxy Manager. I've also deployed lots of different containerized services to help make life easier in the local network.




## My Favorite Projects

#### Blog post @ [Email Server Deployment to help alert scam victims](https://davidinfosec.com/2024/01/alerting-scam-victims-with-self-hosted-email/)

One of my most recent projects is a self-hosted email server that I deployed one morning because a scammer accidentally slipped up and didn't hide their victim list in the email thread. I took advantage of their list of over 400 potential victims as an opportunity to alert them with a friendly email and get hands-on practice with a self-hosted email server, running in a Docker container with a cloud provider.

#### Task Runway @ [TaskRunway.com](https://www.TaskRunway.com) - C# Software / Python Script

Task Runway is by far my one of my most favorite tools. This is what I consider, a runway to all your favorite tools, because it can serve as a central hub for all your custom scripts. My personal use-case is having scripts in random places on my computer and not having to worry about where they are, because Task Runway can do all the management on the backend. It's also an amazing tool for those who are less technical. A great example is for implementation at my church, where the sound team would need to run the [Easy Template](https://www.github.com/davidinfosec/easy-template) script, it makes it way easier for everyone. 

#### Contribute to a safe internet @ [ReportName.com](https://www.ReportName.com)

Discover an organized approach to cybercrime reporting. Born out of my frustrations with tab chaos, this platform allows visual tracking of resources. Respected by industry professionals, it's more than a project—it's a commitment to a safer internet.

#### My Technical Blog @ [DavidInfosec.com](https://www.DavidInfosec.com)

The goal with the DavidInfosec.com blog is to cultivate an environment for others to learn about my technical findings in a fun and engaging way, while also helping to provide critical insight on processes where documentation is scarce.

#### Python Script @ [Easy Template](https://www.github.com/davidinfosec/easy-template)

I created Easy Template sponteaneously to help with a task at my church that would usually take me thirty minutes to an hour a month, plus a headache. I then realized how useful it would be to a larger audience, so I tweaked it to work for a variety of projects.

#### A Python Script @ [WHOIS-Domain-Info](https://github.com/davidinfosec/whois-domain-info) 

I created WHOIS-Domain-Info one morning because I wanted to organized a large list of domain names that I manage. It speeds up a process that would have taken nearly double or triple the time and effort. Members in the domain name industry have found value with this tool as well.

#### A Python Script @ [Spotify to YouTube Link Converter](https://github.com/davidinfosec/sp.py)

I created this script because I wanted to send my friends music from YouTube, but I wanted an excuse to be lazy so I could put my time toward other projects.

#### A Python Script @ [Ely.gg CLI Lookup-Tool](https://github.com/davidinfosec/Ely.gg-CLI-Lookup-Tool)

Ely.gg CLI Lookup was created because I wanted to save on time and computer resources when looking up community-submitted prices for items in a popular video game.

#### A Python Script @ [Audio-Stream Detection (VBAN Protocol)](https://github.com/davidinfosec/VBAN-Stream-Detect)

I created Audio-Stream-Detection in conjunction with a project for my church where I wanted audio streaming over the network to be automatically detected from receiving devices.

#### A Python Script @ [DownloadClip](https://github.com/davidinfosec/downloadclip)

DownloadClip is a tool designed to download YouTube videos with an option to clip them afterward. I developed this tool while working on a video project for my church, where the need to download multiple YouTube clips quickly led to the creation of this tool.

#### A Python Script @ [IP Tool](https://github.com/davidinfosec/IP-Tool)

IP Tool allows you to geolocate IP addresses and store the results in a CSV file. It utilizes the [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io) API to retrieve geolocation data. An IT manager found value in this tool, using it to uncover an insider threat.

#### A Python Script @ [FileHelper](https://github.com/davidinfosec/filehelper)

FileHelper is a simple script designed to assist in organizing files. I created this tool to provide a quick method for creating YYYY-MM style subfolders while preserving the parent folder organization.

#### A Python Script @ [Domain Name Ninja](https://github.com/davidinfosec/Domain-Name-Ninja)

Domain Name Ninja is a tool I created to streamline the process of finding available domain names. By combining word list A with word list B, the tool automates a process that would otherwise take hours.
